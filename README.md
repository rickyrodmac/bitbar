# bitbar - Scripts that I use with BitBar

The **“Plugins”** directory has scripts for [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) itself.

The **“other”** directory is for external scripts required for BitBar scripts. (These should be stored somewhere in `$PATH` such as `/usr/local/bin/`.)


## Plugins

- [batteries.5m.sh](https://github.com/tjluoma/bitbar/blob/master/Plugins/batteries.5m.sh) - Check battery level of Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard, but only show in menu bar when battery level is below a certain threshold (which can be configured for each device in the script).

- [ShowMounted.5s.sh](https://github.com/tjluoma/bitbar/blob/master/Plugins/ShowMounted.5s.sh) - Show mounted drives, if any, and offer to reveal them in Finder or eject them.

- [TimeMachine.30s.sh](https://github.com/tjluoma/bitbar/blob/master/Plugins/TimeMachine.30s.sh) - when Time Machine is actively backing up, show more useful / descriptive information than what the standard macOS menu item shows. When Time Machine is not active, no output is given.

- [zoom.5s.sh](https://github.com/tjluoma/bitbar/blob/master/Plugins/zoom.5s.sh) - when Zoom is running, show how much CPU it is using.
